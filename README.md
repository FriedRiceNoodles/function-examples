# Function Examples

This is the home of all the public examples of Shopify Functions. It's used by the CLI when running `yarn shopify app scaffold extension`. Feel free to look around! Do not edit these files directly.

## Local Development

If you wish to run the samples directly from this repository, you must first expand any `.liquid` templates with the following command.

```shell
yarn
yarn expand-liquid 
```
